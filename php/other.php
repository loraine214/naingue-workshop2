                                        -The PT-REPEATER-NM-1CE features a single Ethernet port that can connect a LAN backbone which can also support either six PRI connections to aggregate ISDN lines, or 24 synchronous/asynchronous ports.
                                        -The PT-REPEATER-NM-1CFE Module provides one Fast-Ethernet interface for use with copper media. Ideal for a wide range of LAN applications, the Fast Ethernet network modules support many internetworking features and standards. Single port network modules offer autosensing 10/100BaseTX or 100BaseFX Ethernet. The TX (copper) version supports virtual LAN (VLAN) deployment.

                                        -The single-port Cisco Gigabit Ethernet Network Module (part number PT-REPEATER-NM-1FGE) provides Gigabit Ethernet optical connectivity for access routers. The module is supported by the Cisco 2691, Cisco 3660, Cisco 3725, and Cisco 3745 series routers. This network module has one gigabit interface converter (GBIC) slot to carry any standard copper or optical Cisco GBIC.

                                        Crimping is most extensively used in metalworking. Crimping is commonly used to fix bullets in their cartridge cases, for rapid but lasting electrical connections, securing lids on metal food cans, and many other applications. Because it can be a cold-working technique, crimping can also be used to form a strong bond between the workpiece and a non-metallic component.
