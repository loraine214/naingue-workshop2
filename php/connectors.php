                                        Console connections can be made between PCs and routers or switches. Certain conditions must be met for the console session from the PC to work: the speed on both sides of the connection must be the same, the data bits must be 7 for both or 8 for both, the parity must be the same, the stop bits must be 1 or 2 (but they do not have to be the same), and the flow control can be anything for either side.

                                   Phone line connections can only be made between devices with modem ports. The standard application for modem connections is an end device (such as a PC) dialing into a network cloud.

                                  Serial connections, often used for WAN links, must be connected between serial ports. Note that you must enable clocking on the DCE side to bring up the line protocol. The DTE clocking is optional. You can tell which end of the connection is the DCE side by the small “clock” icon next to the port. If you choose the Serial DCE connection type and then connect two devices, the first device will be the DCE side and the second device will be automatically set to the DTE side. The reverse is true if you choose the Serial DTE connection type.
